* TODO In no particular order
  - Fine-tune or defend the turbulence model that is going to be used.
  - Configure the barotropic model.
	- What type do we use? At the beginning just go with Linear
	- What values do we use?
  - Check the transport properties. The skeleton is already there
	- Suit them to our case. We could use CoolPROP to calculate the exact values.
  - Initial conditions?
	- What do we use for initial pressure?
	- And densisty? For liquid watter, 1000kg/m3 should be good enough.
  - Refine the size of the problem and the bubble

	  
* Information on the decissions taken

** Initial boundary conditions
   - The velocity is 0, we start from an "equilibrium"
   - The alpha of the liquid is 0, 1 for the bubble
   - The k value at t=0 is 0, since the U_avg is also 0 (we do not have turbulence at the beginning anywhere
   - Since k at t=0 is also 0, the values for epsilon, omega and nut are also 0
   - For the time being, the pressure for the bubble is going to be 0
   - For the time being the density for the liquid is set to 1000
